What is the role of a DNS resolver in the DNS hierarchy?,It resolves domain names to IP addresses on behalf of clients.
What is the purpose of the TTL (Time to Live) in a DNS record?,It specifies how long a record should be cached by DNS resolvers.
What is a recursive DNS query?,A query where the DNS server resolves the entire request on behalf of the client.
What is an iterative DNS query?,A query where the DNS server responds with a referral to another server.
What is the function of root servers in DNS?,They direct queries to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers.
What is DNS caching?,The process of temporarily storing DNS query results to improve efficiency and reduce latency.
What is DNS spoofing?,A type of attack where false DNS data is introduced to redirect users to malicious sites.
What is the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative DNS responses?,"Authoritative responses come directly from the domain's nameserver, while non-authoritative responses are from a cache."
What is the function of a TLD (Top-Level Domain) server?,"It handles queries for domains within a specific top-level domain, like .com or .org."
What is DNSSEC?,A security extension to DNS that ensures data authenticity and integrity using digital signatures.
What is the difference between forward and reverse DNS lookups?,"Forward resolves domain names to IPs, while reverse resolves IPs to domain names."
What happens during a DNS zone transfer?,Data is transferred from a primary server to secondary servers to synchronize the zone.
What is the purpose of a stub resolver?,A lightweight resolver that forwards DNS queries to a recursive resolver.
What is the significance of the 'dig' command in DNS?,It is a tool used to query DNS servers for records and debug issues.
What is a split-horizon DNS?,A setup where DNS servers provide different responses based on the requesterâ€™s location or network.
What is the concept of DNS round-robin?,A load-balancing technique where multiple IPs are returned for a single domain in a rotating order.
What is an NXDOMAIN response in DNS?,A response indicating that the queried domain does not exist.
What is a DNS forwarding server?,A server that forwards DNS queries to another server instead of resolving them itself.
What is a wildcard DNS record?,A record that matches all subdomains under a specific domain.
How does DNS handle load balancing?,By distributing traffic among multiple IP addresses for a single domain.
What is the purpose of a reverse DNS PTR record?,To map an IP address back to its associated domain name.
What is DNS amplification?,A DDoS attack that exploits DNS servers to flood a target with traffic.
