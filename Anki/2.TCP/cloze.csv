Selective acknowledgment (SACK) in TCP allows the receiver to inform the sender of {{c1::non-contiguous}} segments it has received.,
TCP uses {{c1::retransmission timers}} and {{c2::duplicate ACKs}} to recover from packet loss.,
"In TCP, the {{c1::socket pair}} (source IP + source port, destination IP + destination port) uniquely identifies a connection.",
The {{c1::URG flag}} in the TCP header indicates that there is {{c2::urgent data}} that should be processed immediately.,
The {{c1::TIME_WAIT}} state ensures the reliability of connection termination by waiting for {{c2::2MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime)}} before closing the connection.,
"In TCP, the {{c1::SYN flag}} is used to initiate a connection, while the {{c2::FIN flag}} is used to terminate it.",
"The {{c1::checksum}} field in the TCP header is used for error detection across the segment, including data and header.",
"TCP achieves flow control through the {{c1::window size}} field, which indicates the buffer space available at the receiver.",
"The {{c1::PSH flag}} forces the immediate delivery of data to the application layer, bypassing buffer delays.",
